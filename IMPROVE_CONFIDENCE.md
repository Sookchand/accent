## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- pip package manager
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Setting Up Dependencies

### 1. Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is essential for audio processing. Without it, the application falls back to using sample audio, which significantly reduces accuracy.

Run the provided script to check if FFmpeg is installed and get installation instructions:

```bash
python install_ffmpeg.py
```

Follow the instructions provided by the script to install FFmpeg for your platform.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages

Install the correct version of the OpenAI package and other dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai==0.28.0
pip install pytube
pip install yt-dlp
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

### 3. Set Up OpenAI API Key

Create or update your `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Collecting a Real Dataset

The most important factor for improving confidence is having a good training dataset.

### 1. Run the Data Collection Script

```bash
python collect_real_dataset.py
```

This interactive script helps you:
- Download audio from YouTube videos with known accents
- Process existing audio files
- Record audio directly from your microphone

### 2. Collect Sufficient Data

For best results, aim to collect:
- At least 20 samples per accent (50+ is ideal)
- 5-10 seconds of clear speech per sample
- Diverse speakers (different ages, genders, regional variations)

### 3. Verify Your Dataset

The script will create a structured dataset in the `dataset` directory:
```
dataset/
  american/
  british/
  australian/
  indian/
  canadian/
  metadata.json
```

You can view dataset statistics from the collection script menu.

## Training an Improved Model

Once you have collected a dataset, you can train an improved model.

### 1. Run the Training Script

```bash
python train_improved_model.py
```

### 2. Choose Model Type

The script will prompt you to select a model type:
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Ensemble (combines all of the above)

The ensemble model generally provides the best results but takes longer to train.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

You can choose to perform hyperparameter tuning, which can significantly improve model performance but takes much longer to train.

## Evaluating the Model

The training script will automatically evaluate the model and generate:

1. A confusion matrix showing which accents are confused with each other
2. A classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score
3. A confidence distribution plot

These visualizations are saved in the `models` directory.

## Using the File Upload Feature

The application now supports direct file uploads, which can help improve confidence scores by:
1. Bypassing YouTube download issues
2. Allowing you to use high-quality audio samples
3. Testing with known accent samples

### Uploading Files

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Select the "File Upload" tab in the application

3. Click "Browse files" to select an audio or video file from your computer
   - Supported formats: MP4, MP3, WAV, M4A, AVI, MOV, FLAC, OGG

4. Click "Analyze File" to process the uploaded file

### Using Local Files

You can also use local files directly:

1. Select the "Local Sample" tab in the application

2. Enter the path to your local file (e.g., "MP4_sample")

3. Click "Analyze Local File" to process the file

This is particularly useful for testing with your MP4_sample file or other known accent samples.

## Troubleshooting

### Low Confidence Scores

If you're still seeing low confidence scores:

1. **Use direct file uploads**: Upload high-quality audio files instead of using YouTube URLs
2. **Try your MP4_sample file**: Use the Local Sample feature with your known sample
3. **Check your dataset size**: More data generally leads to better confidence
4. **Ensure audio quality**: Clear speech without background noise works best
5. **Balance your dataset**: Make sure you have similar numbers of samples for each accent
6. **Try different model types**: SVM often works well for smaller datasets, while ensemble models work better for larger datasets
7. **Enable hyperparameter tuning**: This can significantly improve model performance

### FFmpeg Issues

If you're having trouble with FFmpeg:

1. Make sure it's properly installed and in your PATH
2. Restart your terminal/command prompt after installation
3. Try running `ffmpeg -version` to verify the installation

### OpenAI API Issues

If you're having issues with the OpenAI API:

1. Make sure you're using version 0.28.0 of the OpenAI package
2. Check that your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. Verify that your `.env` file is in the correct location (project root)

### File Upload Issues

If you're having issues with file uploads:

1. Check that the file format is supported (MP4, MP3, WAV, etc.)
2. Ensure the file size is within Streamlit's limits (200MB for Streamlit Cloud)
3. Try using the Local Sample feature instead if the file is already on your system

## Next Steps

After implementing these improvements, your accent detection model should have significantly higher confidence scores. You can further improve it by:

1. **Collecting more data**: The more diverse your dataset, the better your model will perform
2. **Implementing deep learning models**: Consider using pre-trained audio models like Wav2Vec2
3. **Adding linguistic analysis**: Analyze transcriptions for accent-specific words and phrases
4. **Implementing a feedback loop**: Collect user feedback to continuously improve your model
