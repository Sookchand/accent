# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Checklist ‚úÖ

Use this checklist to ensure your accent detection app is ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### üìÅ Required Files
- [ ] `app.py` - Main application file
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [ ] `packages.txt` - System packages (contains `ffmpeg`)
- [ ] `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- [ ] `accent_model.py` - Accent detection model
- [ ] `README.md` - Documentation
- [ ] `.gitignore` - Git ignore file

### üîë API Keys Setup
- [ ] Google Gemini API key obtained from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained (optional fallback)
- [ ] API keys tested locally
- [ ] `.env` file excluded from git (in `.gitignore`)

### üß™ Local Testing
- [ ] App runs locally with `streamlit run app.py`
- [ ] File upload functionality works
- [ ] URL input functionality works
- [ ] Local sample functionality works
- [ ] API status shows correctly in sidebar
- [ ] Transcription works with at least one API
- [ ] Accent detection provides results

## Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub repository
- [ ] Repository is public or accessible to Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] All required files are in the repository
- [ ] `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is NOT in the repository (should be in `.gitignore`)

### 2. Streamlit Cloud Configuration
- [ ] Signed up for Streamlit Cloud at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
- [ ] Connected GitHub account
- [ ] Created new app
- [ ] Selected correct repository and branch
- [ ] Set main file path to `app.py`

### 3. Secrets Configuration
- [ ] Opened "Advanced settings" in Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Added secrets in TOML format:
  ```toml
  GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_actual_gemini_api_key_here"
  OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_actual_openai_api_key_here"
  ```
- [ ] Verified no extra spaces or quotes in API keys
- [ ] Saved secrets configuration

### 4. Deployment
- [ ] Clicked "Deploy!" button
- [ ] Waited for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Checked deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Verified app is accessible at provided URL

## Post-Deployment Verification

### üîç Health Check
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Sidebar shows API status correctly
- [ ] Green checkmarks for configured APIs
- [ ] No red error messages on startup

### üéØ Functionality Testing
- [ ] **File Upload**: Upload a small audio/video file
- [ ] **URL Input**: Test with a YouTube URL
- [ ] **Local Sample**: Test if MP4_sample is available
- [ ] **Transcription**: Verify real transcription (not placeholder)
- [ ] **Accent Detection**: Check confidence scores and results
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test with invalid inputs

### üìä Performance Check
- [ ] App responds within reasonable time (< 30 seconds for small files)
- [ ] File upload works for files up to 200MB
- [ ] Memory usage is acceptable
- [ ] No timeout errors during processing

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ‚ùå "No API keys configured" Error
**Solution:**
- Check secrets are properly added in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Verify API key format (no extra spaces or quotes)
- Restart the app if needed

### ‚ùå "FFmpeg not found" Error
**Solution:**
- Ensure `packages.txt` contains `ffmpeg`
- Verify `packages.txt` is in repository root
- Check deployment logs for package installation errors

### ‚ùå Import Errors
**Solution:**
- Verify all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Check for version conflicts
- Use compatible package versions

### ‚ùå File Upload Issues
**Solution:**
- Check file size (max 200MB on Streamlit Cloud)
- Verify supported file formats
- Test with smaller files first

### ‚ùå Transcription Failures
**Solution:**
- Verify API keys are valid and have credits
- Check API usage limits
- Test with shorter audio files

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### üìà Usage Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor API usage in Google AI Studio dashboard
- [ ] Check Streamlit Cloud app metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback and error reports

### üîÑ Updates and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment on git push
- [ ] Plan for API key rotation
- [ ] Monitor for security updates
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

### üìù Documentation
- [ ] Update README with live app URL
- [ ] Document any deployment-specific configurations
- [ ] Maintain changelog for updates

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

‚úÖ **App is accessible** at the Streamlit Cloud URL
‚úÖ **API status shows green** for at least one transcription API
‚úÖ **File upload works** for common audio/video formats
‚úÖ **Transcription produces real text** (not placeholder)
‚úÖ **Accent detection provides** reasonable confidence scores (>60%)
‚úÖ **Error handling works** gracefully for invalid inputs
‚úÖ **Performance is acceptable** for typical use cases

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Share your app** with users and collect feedback
2. **Monitor usage patterns** and optimize accordingly
3. **Consider upgrading** API plans for higher usage
4. **Implement analytics** to track user engagement
5. **Plan feature enhancements** based on user needs
